Centrog is mostly a web viewer for syslog written to a Postgresql database as described here http://rsyslog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/database.html

Also included are details about configuring your syslog server and snippets of code you would add to a python project to log to syslog over the network.

Contributions welcome. I'd be willing to help if there is interest.
